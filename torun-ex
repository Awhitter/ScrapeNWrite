I apologize for the oversight. It seems that the OpenAI API key in the .env file is not set correctly. Let's update the .env file with a placeholder for the API key, and then we'll need to ask the user to provide their actual OpenAI API key.

Now that we've updated the .env file with a placeholder, we need to ask the user to provide their actual OpenAI API key.

Claude has a question:
To run the smart scraper, we need a valid OpenAI API key. Please provide your OpenAI API key:

OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-None-4hvd06z2aCbEbxm9JK3PT3BlbkFJ0TcMSX96pxIhF3g5SC7C"

I apologize for the continued error. It seems that the API key provided is not valid. Let's ask the user to double-check their OpenAI API key and provide it again.

Claude has a question:
It appears that the API key provided is not valid. Please double-check your OpenAI API key and provide it again. Make sure it starts with 'sk-' and doesn't include any quotation marks:

ok just got fresh new one but i dont think this was the issue tbh -- 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

Great news! The smart scraper is now working successfully. Let's break down the results:

The script has successfully scraped the example.com website and extracted the requested information.
The main heading is "Example Domain".
The first paragraph is "This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission."
The script also provides some performance metrics:

Total tokens used: 212
Total cost in USD: $0.00015
Total execution time: 3.651256 seconds
Now that we have the scraper working, let's summarize what we've accomplished and what steps you can take to deploy and use this scraper for other websites.

We've set up the environment by installing the required dependencies.
We've configured the .env file with a valid OpenAI API key.
We've modified the smart_scraper_openai.py script to scrape example.com and extract specific information.
To deploy and use this scraper for other websites:

Modify the source parameter in the SmartScraperGraph initialization to target different websites.
Adjust the prompt parameter to extract different information from the targeted websites.
Run the script using python3 examples/openai/smart_scraper_openai.py whenever you want to scrape a website.
For example, if you want to scrape a different website and extract different information, you can modify the script like this:

smart_scraper_graph = SmartScraperGraph(
    prompt="Extract the product name, price, and description from the website.",
    source="https://www.example-store.com/product-page",
    config=graph_config
)
To deploy this scraper as a service, you could:

Set up a simple web server (e.g., using Flask or FastAPI) that accepts requests with a URL and prompt.
Create an endpoint that runs the scraper with the provided URL and prompt.
Return the scraped results as a JSON response.
Would you like me to provide a basic example of how to set up a simple API server for this scraper?
